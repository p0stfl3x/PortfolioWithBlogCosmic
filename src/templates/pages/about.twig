        I was born in January 1990. After getting my Degree in computer science in 2002, I persuaded my higher study in Human Computer Interaction Design. I got my first job as Graphic Designer in the year 2008. After getting experience in graphic designing for a year, I moved to UI-UX Designing.
        <br><br>
        In 2010, I decided to work as a Freelance Web, UI-UX &amp; Mobile Interface Designer. I find myself still in the learning phase and have strong desire to achieve as many skills as I can.
